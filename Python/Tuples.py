#Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). 
They are defined using parentheses ().

# Tuple example
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Accessing elements

# Tuples are immutable, so you can't do this:
# coordinates[0] = 30  # This would throw an error
