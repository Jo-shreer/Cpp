1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Type: Structured, tabular data with relationships.
Best For: Structured data, ACID compliance, strong consistency.
Examples:
MySQL (open-source, widely used)
PostgreSQL (powerful with JSON support)
Microsoft SQL Server (enterprise use)
Oracle Database (high performance)

2. NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases handle unstructured, semi-structured, and big data efficiently.

a) Document-based Databases
Type: Store data as JSON-like documents.
Best For: Flexible schema, hierarchical data, semi-structured data.
Examples:
MongoDB (most popular, high scalability)
CouchDB (JSON documents, distributed)

b) Key-Value Stores
Type: Store data as key-value pairs (like a dictionary).
Best For: Fast lookups, caching, session management.
Examples:
Redis (in-memory, fast caching)
DynamoDB (AWS managed NoSQL)
RocksDB (high-performance)

c) Column-Family Stores
Type: Data is stored in columns instead of rows.
Best For: High write scalability, analytics, time-series data.
Examples:
Apache Cassandra (distributed, scalable)
HBase (Hadoop ecosystem)

d) Graph Databases
Type: Stores data as nodes and relationships.
Best For: Social networks, recommendation engines.
Examples:
Neo4j (most popular graph DB)
ArangoDB (multi-model)

3. Time-Series Databases
Type: Optimized for time-stamped data.
Best For: IoT, monitoring, finance, logging.
Examples:
InfluxDB (optimized for time-series)
TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension)

4. Search Databases
Type: Optimized for full-text search and analytics.
Best For: Search engines, log analysis.
Examples:
Elasticsearch (powerful search engine)
Solr (Apache Lucene-based)

5. NewSQL Databases
Type: Combines SQL features with NoSQL scalability.
Best For: High scalability with ACID transactions.
Examples:
Google Spanner (global consistency)
CockroachDB (distributed SQL)
