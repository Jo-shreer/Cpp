/*
Why use make_shared?
1. Efficiency: fewer allocations
make_shared allocates one block of memory that holds both the control 
block (reference counts, etc.) and the actual object.
If you do shared_ptr<T> sp(new T(...));, it does two separate allocations â€” 
one for the control block and one for the object.
Fewer allocations mean better performance and less memory fragmentation.

2. Exception safety
When you do shared_ptr<T> sp(new T(...)); if the new T(...) 
throws, memory can leak.
make_shared is exception-safe, meaning it handles object creation and
control block setup atomically.

3. Cleaner, safer syntax
Avoids the raw new keyword, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.
