/*
C++17:
Aggregate initialization includes base classes, 
allowing direct initialization of bases.

Before C++17:
Aggregate initialization (brace initialization without constructors) 
did not include base class members.
So you couldnâ€™t initialize base class parts using braces.

Why useful?
Makes initialization of derived aggregates easier and cleaner.
No need for custom constructors for simple cases.

#include <iostream>

struct Base 
{
    int x;
};

struct Derived : Base 
{
    int y;
};

int main() 
{
    Derived d{1, 2}; // Initializes Base::x = 1, Derived::y = 2
    std::cout << "Derived.x = " << d.x << ", Derived.y = " << d.y << "\n";
    return 0;
}

Output:
Derived.x = 1, Derived.y = 2
