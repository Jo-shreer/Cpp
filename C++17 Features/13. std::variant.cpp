/*
std::variant is a type-safe union â€” holds one of several types.

Before C++17:
Representing a variable that can hold one of many types required:
Unions (unsafe for non-trivial types).
Complex class hierarchies with pointers and virtual functions.
Boost.Variant (third-party library).

Why is it better?
Type-safe, no manual union hacks.
Easy to use with std::visit for handling the active type.
Improves code clarity and safety.
